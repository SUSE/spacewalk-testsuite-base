#   Scenario: Channels
#     Given I am logged in via XML-RPC/activationkey as user "admin" and password "admin"
#     When I add config channels "foo" to a newly created key
#     Then I have to see a new config channel "foo"
#
#     When I add a child channel "bar"
#     Then I can see config child has been added.
